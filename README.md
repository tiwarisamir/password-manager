# PassMan

PassMan is a password manager that allows users to securely store passwords for various websites, ensuring they don't forget them. The frontend is built with ReactJS, utilizing axios for API calls, react-router-dom for routing, and react-hot-toast for notifications. The backend is powered by Express, with MongoDB managed through Mongoose, and security handled by JSON Web Tokens (jsonwebtoken) and bcrypt for password hashing. The frontend is deployed on Vercel, while the backend is hosted on Render.
